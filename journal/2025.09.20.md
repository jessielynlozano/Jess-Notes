# Journal — 9-20-2025

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- The Docker setup took a month
- When you present, talk in pipelines (ingest - store - present), focus on something unique (to understand tradeoffs), share data mapping, create a documentation
- Process: sandbox > dlt > mart (bronze > silver > gold)
- TABLE creates and saves the data like a copy; VIEW is continuously query (saves query rather than table)
- DBEAVER allows us to view the process of the whole pipeline
- Where to input SQL: think of the scope (is it changeable, permanent, etc)
- ENGINE = only saves data for a while (disappears when you shut down the tool)
- YAML is used to configure (key-value pair)
- DBT have an automatic fucntion to understand which should go first based on dependencies
- SQL started from a relational theory

### Remote Setup
**DLT**
- Dbeaver: Connect to remote server 54.87.106.52
- Change compose.yaml to DESTINATION__CLICKHOUSE__CREDENTIALS__HOST:       "54.87.106.52"
- Change 01-dlt-mpg-pipeline.py to @dlt.resource(name="cars_jess")
**DBT**
- Change Clean to mpg_standardized to mpg_standardized_jess
- Change mart cylinders to mpg_standardized_jes
- Change profiles.yml to autompg___cars_jess

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- YAML: Yet Another Markdown Language
- Schema: model of data relations
- Primary Key is the unique id
- Foreign Key id to create relationships

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Raw stays raw!

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- When do we use VIEW and TABLE?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- How Local Setup Works: https://github.com/ogbinar/ftw-de-bootcamp/blob/main/TECHNICAL-README.md
- G6 Data Dictionary:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEI_H3qTLBcVmzg4Vni8EP0Bflqj9eGhY9i2PUqZQZA/edit?gid=0#gid=0

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
It is alright to make mistakes. Good money in Docker.


### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
