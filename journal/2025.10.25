# Journal — 10-11-2025

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Dashboard is meant to show a snapshot of the data
- Dashboard Information Hierarchy
  - Start with the Main KPIs
  - Second would be to show trends
  - Last is the evidence
- 4MAT Storytelling Framework -> non-tech audiences engaged through natural curiosity
  - Why: Why is this important -> activates motivation
  - What: What is this about -> pattern recognition
  - How: How does it work -> satisfies logic
  - Now: What should we do next -> action and retention
Comments on the presentation
- Make sure the person to care -> reframe it to make it more appealinf (give evidence-based storyline on the why)
  - Provide context
  - Add call to action for the audience
How to create a DE slide
- Make sure the sponsors sees how the specific data points/elements are being used in the project
  - Explain how data is used in the whole process
  - Be specific (show how actual data evolves throughout the process)
- Maybe one version each for technical and non-technical

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- 

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- 

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- 

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
-
