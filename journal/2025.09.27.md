# Journal — 9-20-2025

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Identify the question you wanted to ansnwer then usually Fact Table (Numerical) Dimensions (Non-Numerical)
- Snowflake is joining dimension to dimension

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- None for this week.

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Raw stays raw!
- Reproducible

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- To keep the data consistent, our team chose to only have one person responsible for ingesting and cleaning of data.
- We had to make our visualizations simple to catch up with the deadline set.
- We had to let go of one business question because we missed out on one variable in our fact table.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- How to ingest using local files? https://chatgpt.com/c/68d61622-6628-8324-9f29-12b8b506445b
- What best practices in our group should we apply to prevent late submission again?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] try to run the whole process by myself 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- Group 6 Metabase: https://ftw.dataengineering.ph/dashboard/37-group-6-dashboard-chinook?tab=36-tab-1

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
Data Engineering is a collaborative job.

Before, I used to think becoming a data professional is a lone person job because you tend to focus on what you can do technical-wise. During the last few weeks I realized how much of a group job it is and it taught me how tech professionals colloborate on a certain job. Prior to this, I was confused how two or more people codes for the same project at the same time because I see tech as a very lone-person work. I have been proven wrong.
