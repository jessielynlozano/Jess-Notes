## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Raw should stay raw
- Usual data is not usually made understandable because it prioritizes efficieny. When cleaning, better to add another column representing the change rather than transforming the raw.
- Make sure to focus on framing the problems first. Normally DEs do not own the business questions, but it will be greatly helpful in creating the pipeline.
    - Business Questions are usually about making money, save money, and compliance
- Trade offs are essential and inevitable. Data has history so it usually happens that companies have existing data models already that has been edited time and time again which leads to trade offs.
- Data quality is all about creating data that people actually trusts.
- Five Dimensions of DQ: Accuracy, Completeness, Reliability, Revelevancy, and Timeliness.
  - Ingestion (raw): schema/type, categories, FKs
  - Transform (clean): null, categories, FKs
  - Mart: reasonableness, uniqueness, business rules
  - ReportingL last-updated, data health cards
- 

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- Data Quality Contract: creating an agreement with the business on what they require in the reports (thresholds, SLA, owner)

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- 

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- 

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] try to run the whole process by myself 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- Group 6 Metabase OULAD: https://ftw.dataengineering.ph/dashboard/43-group-6-oulad

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
Creating things that will persist over time.
Data quality is king.
